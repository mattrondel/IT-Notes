Adding transitions
https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/transition-overview-applying-transitions.html

cross disolve it a good transition
play it back if it looks to short then edit the transition time to 1.5 seconds or 2

to avoid the message "Insufficient media this transition will contain repeated frames"
cut a few frames before or after the clips then add the transition
