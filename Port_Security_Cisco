#Show port-security - displays list of all ports with port security  and thier status

secure port  max secure(addr (count)  current addr(count)  secure violation(count)  secure action
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
fa 0/1          1                        1                    0                         shutdown
fa 0/2          1                        1                    1                         shutdown
look in the secure violation(count) if troubleshooting also port light will be off (probably)


if security violation count = 1 
querery the interface
#show port security interface fa 0/1
port status     secure shutdown
...
...

last source addr4ess : vlan: AAAA:BBBB:CCCC:1 <- This is the last mac address that tripped port secuirty
if you have sticky mac enabled then you can compare the sticky mac and see the difference

# show interface fa 0/2
fast ethernet 0/2 is down, line protocol is down (err-disabled) <- look for this with ports in question with port security


"Modes" of port security
 - Protect does not accept traffic after violation
 - Restrict - creates/generates a log and increments counter on show port-security interface fa 0/1
 - Shutdown - disables port with err-disabled
gernates log and trap (snmp)
default function with mac address of 1
