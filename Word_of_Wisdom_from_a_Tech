                Word of Wisdom from a Tech
==============================================================

1.	You will never know everything there is to know about fixing stuff.

2.	Make sure you are quiet and LISTEN to what the customer has to say before you start asking questions

3.	Know when to cry uncle. Take 30 minutes to figure out a problem on your own. If you cannot do it by then, call for help (tech support, google, etc)

4.	Never stop training. If you do, you will be left behind

5.	If you think you know everything about a product, look at rule one.

6.	Network with other techs. You will soon realize how much help they can be. Share information when it comes to solving problems. It will come back to you 10 fold.

7.	A smile will work wonders

8.	DO NOT treat the customer like an idiot but tell them only what they need to know.

9.	Never, never change the settings for appearance on the end users system, no matter how much it drives you crazy. It is their system and not yours.

10.	Keep all of you certifications in a protective sleeve in a notebook

11.	You can refuse service. If you feel that you are treated badly – pack up. Call you boss after you leave and let them know what happened. Keep a written record.

12.	Keep your eyes on the task at hand. Some end users will have papers on their desk that are private. That means you have no business looking at them.

13.	RTFM. Read the “fine” manual. Almost every service manuals have a section on troubleshooting

14.	Some employees believe companies owe them – like five finger discount parts and copies of software. Behavior like this is not only unethical; it will sooner or later cause a CLM (career limiting maneuver).

15.	The last thing: RELAX It’s just a job. Have fun.
